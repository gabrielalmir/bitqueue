# BitQueue Backend Development Plan

**As the sole developer, this document outlines the prioritized development process for BitQueue's backend. The focus is on delivering a functional queue system first, followed by integrations, user interfaces, and AI capabilities. Sprints are organized to ensure efficient progress, with all planned features implemented incrementally.**

## Primary Features to Prioritize
- **Queue Management**: Core system to enqueue and process tasks reliably.
- **Integrations**: Email, Excel, Google Drive, WhatsApp, Slack.
- **User Interface**: Dashboard for non-technical users.
- **API**: HTTP endpoints for technical users.
- **AI Integration**: Optional ChatGPT support via user-provided API key.

## Sprint Organization
- **Duration**: Weekly or bi-weekly sprints for focused, achievable goals.
- **Approach**: Build incrementally, starting with the core system, then adding user-facing features and integrations.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Sprint 1: Core Queue System
- **Goal**: Establish the foundational queue management system.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Set up project with Node.js and TypeScript.
  - [ ] Implement enqueue and process functions using AWS SQS.
  - [ ] Design DynamoDB schema (e.g., `queue_id`, `message_id`, `status`, `payload`, `created_at`).
  - [ ] Write unit tests for enqueue and process logic.
- **Outcome**: A working queue system to handle tasks.

### Sprint 2: Basic API
- **Goal**: Expose queue functionality via HTTP API.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Set up a RESTful API with Fastify or Hono.
  - [ ] Implement `POST /enqueue` and `GET /status/:id` endpoints.
  - [ ] Add API key authentication.
  - [ ] Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
- **Outcome**: Developers can interact with BitQueue programmatically.

### Sprint 3: User Interface Basics
- **Goal**: Create a simple dashboard for non-technical users.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Set up a frontend with React or Vue.
  - [ ] Build a dashboard to list queues and tasks.
  - [ ] Add a form to configure basic automations (trigger + action).
  - [ ] Connect frontend to backend API.
- **Outcome**: Non-technical users can manage automations via UI.

### Sprint 4: Integrations - Email and Excel
- **Goal**: Add initial external integrations.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Implement email sending via SMTP (e.g., SendGrid).
  - [ ] Add Excel integration using Google Sheets API.
  - [ ] Update UI to support email and Excel configuration.
  - [ ] Write integration tests for both services.
- **Outcome**: Users can automate email and Excel tasks.

### Sprint 5: Integrations - Google Drive and WhatsApp/Slack
- **Goal**: Complete remaining integrations.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Implement Google Drive integration for file operations.
  - [ ] Add WhatsApp integration via Twilio API.
  - [ ] Implement Slack integration using webhooks.
  - [ ] Update UI to configure these integrations.
- **Outcome**: Full integration suite available.

### Sprint 6: AI Integration
- **Goal**: Enable optional ChatGPT functionality.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Add secure storage for user-provided ChatGPT API keys (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).
  - [ ] Implement OpenAI API calls for AI-enabled workflows.
  - [ ] Update UI with AI toggle and prompt input.
  - [ ] Ensure AI is optional and secure.
- **Outcome**: Users can enhance automations with AI.

### Sprint 7: Polish and Testing
- **Goal**: Refine and stabilize the system.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Improve UI/UX based on initial testing.
  - [ ] Add comprehensive tests (unit, integration, edge cases).
  - [ ] Set up logging and monitoring with AWS CloudWatch.
  - [ ] Optimize performance and cost (e.g., Lambda memory).
- **Outcome**: A production-ready system.

### Sprint 8: Deployment and Documentation
- **Goal**: Launch and document the application.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Deploy backend to AWS Lambda or ECS.
  - [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel or AWS Amplify.
  - [ ] Write user guides (API and UI).
  - [ ] Set up feedback mechanism (e.g., email form).
- **Outcome**: BitQueue is live and user-ready.
