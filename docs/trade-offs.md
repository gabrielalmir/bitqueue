# Trade-offs for BitQueue

## Node.js (Lambda), Java (Lambda) vs Java (EC2)

### Cost Comparison (USD/month)

| Messages/Month | Node.js (Lambda) | Java (Lambda) | Java (EC2) |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| **0-10**       | $2.17            | $2.17         | $9.76      |
| **10k**        | $2.17            | $2.21         | $9.80      |
| **50k**        | $2.30            | $2.47         | $9.84      |
| **100k**       | $2.37            | $2.67         | $9.89      |
| **1M**         | $4.02            | $7.36         | $11.39     |
| **50M**        | $614.09          | $821.80       | $821.42    |

### My Analysis

When I analyzed the costs, I noticed distinct patterns across the usage scenarios:

- **Low to Medium Usage (0-10 to 1M messages/month)**:
  I found that Node.js on Lambda is the most cost-effective option, primarily because it uses less memory (256 MB) and has faster cold starts (~1s), making great use of the AWS free tier. Java on Lambda is slightly more expensive due to its higher memory needs (512 MB) and longer execution time (500 ms), but it remains competitive. Hosting Java on EC2, however, is much more expensive in these scenarios because of the fixed cost of the t3.micro instance ($7.59/month), while Lambda's pay-per-use model keeps costs near zero with the free tier.

- **High Scale (50M messages/month)**:
  At this scale, Node.js on Lambda remains the cheapest at $614.09, thanks to its efficiency. Java on Lambda costs $821.80, which is higher due to the increased memory and execution time. Interestingly, Java on EC2 becomes competitive at $821.42, as the fixed EC2 cost ($7.59) becomes a small fraction of the total, but Node.js on Lambda still offers better savings.

### Documenting My Trade-offs: Lambda vs. EC2

I evaluated the trade-offs between using Lambda (for both Node.js and Java) and hosting Java on EC2 to decide the best approach for BitQueue:

- **Lambda (Node.js and Java)**:
  I chose Lambda for its automatic scalability and low initial costs, especially in low to medium usage scenarios. The pay-per-use pricing model, combined with the AWS free tier, makes it nearly cost-free for small workloads (e.g., 0-10 to 10k messages). Node.js performs better due to its lower memory usage and faster cold starts (~1s), while Java on Lambda requires more memory and has longer cold starts (~8s without SnapStart). I mitigated Java's cold start issue by enabling SnapStart, reducing it to ~2s, but it still impacts latency slightly. Another consideration is that Lambda abstracts infrastructure management, which simplifies operations but introduces a dependency on AWS's serverless ecosystem.

- **EC2 (Java)**:
  Hosting Java on EC2 with a t3.micro instance provides a fixed cost of $7.59/month, which is advantageous at high scale (e.g., 50M messages) where it becomes cost-competitive with Java on Lambda ($821.42 vs. $821.80). I also appreciate that EC2 eliminates cold starts, ensuring consistent latency (~200 ms per request), which is better for user experience in high-traffic scenarios. However, this approach requires me to manage the infrastructure, including patching, monitoring, and scaling. At 50M messages, I would need to add Auto Scaling and an Application Load Balancer (ALB, ~$16.20/month + $0.008/GB), which increases costs and complexity. Additionally, the fixed cost of EC2 makes it less economical for low usage, where Lambda shines.
