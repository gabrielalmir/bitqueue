### Cost Comparison (USD/month)

| Messages/Month | Node.js (Lambda) | Java (Lambda) | Java (EC2) | Go (Lambda) |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| **0-10**       | $2.17            | $2.17         | $9.76      | $2.17       |
| **10k**        | $2.17            | $2.21         | $9.80      | $2.17       |
| **50k**        | $2.30            | $2.47         | $9.84      | $2.29       |
| **100k**       | $2.37            | $2.67         | $9.89      | $2.35       |
| **1M**         | $4.02            | $7.36         | $11.39     | $3.81       |
| **50M**        | $614.09          | $821.80       | $821.42    | $603.84     |

### My Analysis

When I analyzed the costs, I noticed distinct patterns across the usage scenarios:

- **Low to Medium Usage (0-10 to 1M messages/month)**:
  I found that both Node.js and Go on Lambda are the most cost-effective options, primarily because they use less memory (256 MB) and have faster cold starts (~1s for Node.js, ~1.5s for Go), making great use of the AWS free tier. Go is slightly cheaper than Node.js due to its faster execution time (150 ms vs. 200 ms per request). Java on Lambda is more expensive due to its higher memory needs (512 MB) and longer execution time (500 ms), but it remains competitive. Hosting Java on EC2, however, is much more expensive in these scenarios because of the fixed cost of the t3.micro instance ($7.59/month), while Lambda's pay-per-use model keeps costs near zero with the free tier.

- **High Scale (50M messages/month)**:
  At this scale, Go on Lambda is the cheapest at $603.84, thanks to its efficiency and faster execution. Node.js on Lambda follows closely at $614.09. Java on Lambda costs $821.80, which is higher due to the increased memory and execution time. Interestingly, Java on EC2 becomes competitive at $821.42, as the fixed EC2 cost ($7.59) becomes a small fraction of the total, but Go and Node.js on Lambda still offer better savings.

### Documenting My Trade-offs: Lambda vs. EC2

I evaluated the trade-offs between using Lambda (for Node.js, Java, and Go) and hosting Java on EC2 to understand the best approach for BitQueue:

- **Lambda (Node.js, Java, and Go)**:
  I appreciate Lambda for its automatic scalability and low initial costs, especially in low to medium usage scenarios. The pay-per-use pricing model, combined with the AWS free tier, makes it nearly cost-free for small workloads (e.g., 0-10 to 10k messages). Go performs the best due to its lower memory usage (256 MB), faster execution (150 ms), and minimal cold starts (~1.5s), closely followed by Node.js (200 ms, ~1s cold starts). Java on Lambda requires more memory (512 MB) and has longer cold starts (~8s without SnapStart). I mitigated Java's cold start issue by enabling SnapStart, reducing it to ~2s, but it still impacts latency slightly. Another consideration is that Lambda abstracts infrastructure management, which simplifies operations but introduces a dependency on AWS's serverless ecosystem.

- **EC2 (Java)**:
  Hosting Java on EC2 with a t3.micro instance provides a fixed cost of $7.59/month, which is advantageous at high scale (e.g., 50M messages) where it becomes cost-competitive with Java on Lambda ($821.42 vs. $821.80). I also value that EC2 eliminates cold starts, ensuring consistent latency (~200 ms per request), which is better for user experience in high-traffic scenarios. However, this approach requires me to manage the infrastructure, including patching, monitoring, and scaling. At 50M messages, I would need to add Auto Scaling and an Application Load Balancer (ALB, ~$16.20/month + $0.008/GB), which increases costs and complexity. Additionally, the fixed cost of EC2 makes it less economical for low usage, where Lambda shines.
